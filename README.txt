==================================
Xnor.ai Developer SDK Beta 0.9 RC4
==================================

Thank you for choosing Xnor.ai!

With this SDK the power of AI is at your fingertips.  For general documentation
about how to use Xnor Model Bundles, and samples of what you can do with them,
start by exploring `docs/Xnor.ai Documentation.html`.  To find more information
about the bundles available in your distribution, view the README docs in each
`lib/<target>/<model>` subdirectory.

This SDK comes with several sample models that demonstrate how to use and
interact with Xnor Bundles, but these are just a taste of what Xnor has to offer.
You can browse a marketplace full of models with different sizes, tasks, and use
cases at the following URL:
